# cdn
my own cdn

## want to make your own?
1) create a githup repo, name it cdn (or whatever you want)
2) upload images to it to use
3) get those images using `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{your username}/{repository name}/{file name and extension}`
 e.g if I had a file called `my_cool_image.png`, I would use the following URL: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dainfloop/cdn/my_cool_image.png`
